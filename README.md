# Pure Twitch

Remove all the sexual content from Twitch.tv, such as bikini streams, twerking streams, and streamers that show too much cleavage.

## How it works

Pure Twitch is a browser extension that checks each stream on Twitch.tv against a blocklist of streamers that are known to show sexual content. If a streamer is on the blocklist, the stream will be hidden from the user.

## Installation

1. Download the latest version of the extension from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ejihgokacjmjhihjppdomnagfilijfke/), [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/pure-twitch/), or [manually](#manual-installation).
2. Install the extension in your browser.
3. Visit [Twitch.tv](https://www.twitch.tv/) and enjoy a cleaner Twitch experience.

## Manual Installation

### Chrome

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`.
3. Enable "Developer mode" in the top right corner.
4. Click "Load unpacked" and select repo folder.
5. The extension should now be installed and active.

## Missed a stream or accidentally blocked a safe streamer?

If I missed a stream or accidentally blocked a safe streamer, please [open an issue](https://github.com/Atlas7005/puretwitch/issues/new) and I will investigate.
